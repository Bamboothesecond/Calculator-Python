Calculator Graphical User Interface
*By Bamboothesecond

This calculator has a graphical user interface that is fully functional. However, I don't think it's completely flawless yet. For instance, I haven't made the output box read-only, and I've been experiencing some errors when clicking on it, such as getting a duplicate value when inputting a single one.
